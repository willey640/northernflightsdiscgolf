      <p>June is Pride Month. A time to celebrate diversity, inclusion, and the freedom for everyone to be their true selves. 
        At the end of the day, we're all disc golfers first, united by our love for the game and the community it builds. 
        No matter who you are or who you love, you’re welcome on the course. Let’s continue to respect and support one another, 
        on and off the fairway.

      <h2>Important Notice: The Flin Flon Spring League is cancelled until Further Notice</h2>
      <img src="static/Photos/fire logo.png" alt="Fire Logo" style="width: auto; max-height: 75vh;" />
      
      <p>In light of the recent mandatory evacuation order issued for Flin Flon due to the ongoing wildfire and the associated safety risks, we have to cancel the 2025 Flin Flon Spring League. The health and well-being of our players and their families must take priority during this emergency. 
        We extend our deepest gratitude to the brave firefighters, emergency responders, and support personnel who continue to work around the clock to protect our community. Your courage, dedication, and selflessness are truly appreciated.
        Please follow all official evacuation instructions and safety advisories from local authorities. We will monitor conditions closely and hope to return to the course when it is safe for everyone. Stay safe, and thank you for your understanding and support.
