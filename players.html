        <h2>Mario Disc Golf 64</h2>
        <p><strong>April Fools</strong><br>
          Back on April 1, 2025, we launched a fun April Fools' joke: Mario Disc Golf 64. It was only live for 12 hours, but it definitely made an impression. Since then, we've received tons of emails asking how to play it again... So by popular demand, it's back <strong>(for now)!</strong> Enjoy!</p>
